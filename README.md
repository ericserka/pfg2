# Final graduation project.

Monorepo for the proposed app in my final graduation project.

## Notes

- to run yarn commands in a specific workspace without having to keep going into your directory: `yarn workspace <WORKSPACE_NAME> <DESIRED_COMMAND>`. Example: `yarn workspace @pfg2/server dev` initialize the server in development mode.
